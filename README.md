# SELFLESS

# Start: 🎮 🏁

Welcome to SELFLESS!

SELFLESS is an independent role-playing video game for all ages.

It is a passion project I began developing in the spring of 2024 while in college. 

All I have available for now is my first-shot Summer 2024 Demo or "Zero Draft", which can be viewed on the branch SLFL-ZERO-DRAFT.

I’ll be documenting SELFLESS's creation here on my GitHub, Instagram, and Cara! 

Join me in the journey!



# Storyline: 📝 🪴

A family of ANIMAL SPIES learn about the TRUE nature of LOVE and SELFLESSNESS as they SAVE the WORLD from a MYSTERIOUS ROBOT system that has the power to manipulate DARKNESS.

The player weaves through the STORIES of various characters or SELVES, who each go through unique personal struggles. They each learn to look BEYOND themselves, HELPING each other to HEAL and GROW.

Together, they discover a GOODNESS GREATER than the DARKNESS in the world; one that is STRONG enough to even HEAL the darkness within THEMSELVES.

DURIAN AGUARA 🦊
- By day, a middle school band teacher. By night, running missions for SPY HQ. Husband to ELISIA, dad to MIRY, uncle to MILO. Reluctantly moved his family back to his hometown to take up a teaching job and be closer to SPY HQ. Afraid to REPEAT the past and is learning what is means to REDEEM it.

ELISIA (ELLY) AGUARA 🦭
- Linguist who gathers intel and runs tech support for SPY HQ, adjusting to work and family life after maternity leave. Wife to DURIAN, mom to MIRY, aunt to MILO.  Iron fist, iron glove; her strong heart is grounded in LOVE. She believes in love’s power to RESTORE all things, as she had so been as a former shut-in.

MIRABELLE (MIRY) AGUARA 🦊🦭
- Not-so-secret official mascot of SPY HQ. Baby of DURIAN and ELISIA, cousin to MILO. An absolute bundle of joy learning about all the amazing things in the world! Knows how to REJOICE in what we see as the little things, but to her are so big and wonderful!

MILO BUBBLES 🐶
- Adoptive teen son of BUBBLES, nephew of the AGUARAS, and best friend of DANTE. Grapples with dark unknowns about his birth, identity, and purpose in life. Attempts to REBUILD his SELF in his journey to become the best coder - if he can control computers, then maybe people will stop treating him like one.

BUBBLE S. BUBBLES 🐳
- Dad to MILO. Scientist who runs a medical charity for orphans, and is the CEO of SPY HQ. The last vaquita stricken with grief at the loss of his family, his first and last joy. Attempts to REGAIN the PAST through a series of dubious science experients involving cyborg and memory-altering technology.

DANTE LECHON 🐷
- Best friend of MILO and pretty much everybody. Literally the friendliest guy, would drop everything just to help tie your shoe. Is set to inherit Loaf-tometry, his family’s bakery and optometry business. The pressure REVEALS his heart as he learns to let go of anxiety and allow his trials to REFINE him.

BERTA BULLSEYE 🐶🍵
- Is green because she drank too much matcha. The chillest girl who knows how to lock in, stay focused on her dreams, and hit REFRESH each day. Befriends MILO and DANTE at school - she’s new to their town, but for some reason they seem familiar, as if they’ve been friends all their lives. Weird, huh???

??? ?? 🐔🕶️
- An elusive inventor who betrayed SPY HQ. Believes Bubbles’ cyborg project holds the key to immortality, so he stole part of his lab. He gained the ability to teleport and builds machines that can manipulate darkness. Attempts to REINVENT the WORLD, to become the god who can FIX ALL THINGS.
