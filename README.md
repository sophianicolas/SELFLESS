# SELFLESS

>>> Start: üéÆ üèÅ

Welcome to SELFLESS!

SELFLESS is an independent role-playing video game for all ages.

It is a passion project I began developing in the spring of 2024 while in college. 

I‚Äôll be documenting its creation here on my GitHub, Instagram, and Cara! 

Join me in the journey!



>>> Storyline: üìù ü™¥

A family of ANIMAL SPIES learn about the TRUE nature of LOVE and SELFLESSNESS as they SAVE the WORLD from a MYSTERIOUS ROBOT system that has the power to manipulate DARKNESS.

The player weaves through the STORIES of various characters or SELVES, who each go through unique personal struggles. They each learn to look BEYOND themselves, HELPING each other to HEAL and GROW.

Together, they discover a GOODNESS GREATER than the DARKNESS in the world; one that is STRONG enough to even HEAL the darkness within THEMSELVES.


>>> Selves: 

DURIAN AGUARA ü¶ä

ELISIA (ELLY) AGUARA ü¶≠
- Linguist who gathers intel and runs tech support for SPY HQ, adjusting to work and family life after maternity leave. Wife to DURIAN, mom to MIRY, aunt to MILO.

MILO BUBBLES üê∂
- Adoptive teen son of BUBBLES, nephew of the AGUARAS, and best friend of DANTE. Grapples with dark unknowns about his birth, identity, and purpose in life. Attempts to REBUILD his SELF in his journey to become the best coder - if he can control computers, then maybe people will stop treating him like one.

BERTA BULLSEYE üê∂üçµ
- Is green because she drank too much matcha. The chillest girl who knows how to lock in, stay focused on her dreams, and hit REFRESH each day. Befriends MILO and DANTE at school - she‚Äôs new to their town, but for some reason they seem familiar, as if they‚Äôve been friends all their lives. Weird, huh???

??? ?? üêîüï∂Ô∏è
- An elusive inventor who betrayed SPY HQ. Believes Bubbles‚Äô cyborg project holds the key to immortality, so he stole part of his lab. He gained the ability to teleport and builds machines that can manipulate darkness. Attempts to REINVENT the WORLD, to become the god who can FIX ALL THINGS.
